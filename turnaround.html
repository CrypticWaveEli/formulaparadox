                You scan the island.  The more you look at this sandy, misty paradise, the worse the feeling in the pit of your stomach gets.  You make no move to disembark from the gently rocking fishing boat.  <br><br>"Nope" you finally decide. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You turn back around to the captian and his grim face.  The two of you lock eyes.  He nods almost imperceptibly, moves the few feet back to the small bridge and turns the boat slowly away from the island.  you expect relief to wash over you as soon as you glide back into the open ocean, back towards the main land, back towards safey, but the feeling of forboading is hard to shake.  You wonder, as the sun begins to burn off the mist and warm you, if you will ever feel safe again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You resist the urge to turn around and take a last look at the slowly shrinking island.
