            Even though you are hot, sweaty and exhausted from hiking, you press forward, the eerie feeling from this morning has not gone far from your mind.  Even though the jungle is alive with the sounds of animals and life, there is something disquieting and off about it.  You feel like you are being watched, a thousand million little tropical eyes roaming all over your sunburnt skin.  All the time.  You are uttely alone and being stalked and hunted like prey all at the same time.  
            </p>

            you shake your head in hopes of dislodging the paranoia and refocusing on your task, you have a job to do after all.  Pausing your relentless march under a large sprawling palm, the brief thought to try and find some young coconuts to slack your thirst flit across younr mind, but are quickly dismissed as you dig through your rucksack.  A wickedly sharp machete, a small cooking pot, ferro rod, water canteen, a small equally as sharp hunting knife, compass, map and a large manilla envalope stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" in large red official looking letters. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Sipping judiciously from the canteen, you contemplate your next move.

            I'm exhausted but I also dont want to be here any longer than I have to be. The faster I find *whatever* it is im looking for, the faster I can leave this creepy island.<a href="mapquest.html">I hope I remember how to read a map!</a>
