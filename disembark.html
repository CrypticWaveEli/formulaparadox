            You grab your rucksack and glance back at the stoic captain.  His eyes are sharp and alert, his second-hand tank top flutters over his muscular chest in the salty breeze. His rigid posture and stony expression make you uneasy. You swallow uneasily and hoist yourself over the edge of the boat into clear blue waist deep water. Rucksack held aloft over your head, you turn to thank the captain but he is already at the rudder stearing the creaking ancient boat back to the main land.

            Despite the chilly breeze and the icy water, the sand is already starting to  warm.  As the early morning mist burns off, the temperature steadily and quickly increases.

             You walk up and down the beach a little ways, exploring and trying to find your bearings. You scan the treeline looking for an obvious path, you realize that like a real adventurer, you will need to blaze your own trail.
             </p>

            Leaving the shore behind you find yourself in a thick lush jungle. The sun is beating down through the tropical canopy, birds warble and monkeys hoot somewhere off in the distance, strange and foreign insects buzz menacingly, attracted to your sweaty, salty skin. The air is moist and hangs heavy and still; it feels like you will never be able to get enough oxygen in your lungs for a proper deep breath.

            <p>
            You have been wandering for hours, the pack on your back is heavy and your mouth is as dry as the sand beneath your feet.
