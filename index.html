            The rickety fishing boat drifts through clear azure waters to a sandy beach. 
            The local man who pilots it says nothing, his face grim,  
            he lets the boat idle in the early morning mist, waiting for you to disembark.

            The island is beautiful for sure. White sandy beaches give way to dense verdant jungle, Palm trees heavy with coconuts still and quiet in the early hour. Much further into the interior of the island, gray craggy mountains rise from the foliage, mountain tops obscured my low hanging clouds.

             Despite the beauty, a cold shiver runs through you that has 
            nothing to do with the morning chill.

     <p>Nope.  Absolutely Not. No thanks,
